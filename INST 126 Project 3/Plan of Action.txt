INST 126 Plan of Action- Project 3

For Project 3, one approach that I plan to take is to import both regular expressions and pandas to help 
grab the data I need and to structure the data in a table like manner. I also plan to use a function that includes the readlines method 
to return a list that contains objects on each line in the file as a list item. 
The next thing I would do is define regular expressions to match the strings that I'm looking for within the text file. This includes 
(but not limited to) the selected users, the date, & the server of where the incident occured. 
I also plan to create another empty list that will contain data from the text file (which will append to the empty list)
as well as iterables to help check for regular expression matches in the text file (at least one while loop). 
Conditional statements will also be used to find incident dates, names, & times. 
The last thing I will do is create a function that stores all log entries from the text file and create a count variable for each incident and activity
that occurred (and print the output).  
Since this project is fairly large in nature, for the first week I hope to get down the structure of how I want the output to be presented, as well as
break apart each individual issue step by step (suspicious activity, system glitches, etc.).
