## General
> This project is based on Python reading & parsing a userlog file. 

## Setup
> This project should be ran on applications that support Python 3. 

## Flow for solving the Project
> The first thing I will address about this project is that I will not be able to 100% complete it in the manner that is expected in the course sample text. 
> With that being said, however, I do expect to be able to deliver results for each of the 4 main components of the project, even if those results are not the most pleasing. 
> Lastly, while there are a great many ways of doing this assignment (which is arguably the hardest part of this project), I am going to work on it the best way I know how. 
>Additionally, I expect there to be quite a few text files that python will be writing that contains information specific for each deliverable.
