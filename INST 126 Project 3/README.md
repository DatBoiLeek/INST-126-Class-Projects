## General
> This project is based on Python reading & parsing a userlog file. 

## Setup
> This project should be ran on applications that support Python 3. 

## Flow for solving the Project
> The first thing I will address about this project is that I will not be able to 100% complete it in the manner that is expected in the course sample text. 
> With that being said, however, I do expect to be able to deliver results for each of the 4 main components of the project, even if those results are not the most pleasing. 
> Lastly, while there are a great many ways of doing this assignment (which is arguably the hardest part of this project), I am going to work on it the best way I know how. 
>Additionally, I expect there to be quite a few text files that python will be writing that contains information specific for each deliverable. 

## Any other challenges encountered so far? 
> Yes, as of 10/30/2020, I have encountered several challenges so far, the biggest being both the irresponsible log and glitch log. I have focused my efforts on the irresponsible 
> log right now though. I did manage to print out each and every person who did not logout from the userlog file (there are about 2k entries, roughly half of the userlog text file). The challenge is setting the output of each entry to be the same, as only one user has the correct notation. If all else fails I will gladly move on to work on the glitch report, which has proven to be its' own challenge.  

## 11/1/2020 Update
> As of 11/1/20, I was able to solve quite a bit of the project, especially for the glitch log. The output of the glitch log contains every single user that logged out more than they logged in. The problem, however, is exactly the same as with the irresponsible log. Additionally, I created a domain log function that returns the count of every single email domain that is referenced in the user log. I can safely say that the project is near completition, and I hope to be able to solve the irresponsible log and glitch log. As it stands, the only perfect log output is the suspicious text file I have python writing to. All of the other log files that I have written to indeed solves the problem, but not with a desirable output.
